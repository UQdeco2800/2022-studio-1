STARTING THE GAME

Hello [USERNAME]! My name is [MAIN CHARACTER NAME]. We need your help in keeping our beloved Atlantis from sinking!


DAY TIME

During the day, you can build the city and prepare for your battle against our enemies tonight. Create the most developed city possible!

To build a building, we must gather some resources first!

We have to break this rock to get some resources. The more you break, the more you will gain! 

Make sure to keep the crystal safe! Our city will sink if it is damaged by the monsters that will attack us at night.

It’s getting dark now. Make sure to buy what you need from the store before it closes!


NIGHT TIME

The moon has risen! We must be alert for enemies that come from the water! Defend our city as well as you can!

Guard the crystal as best as you can. The whole city depends on it!

Eliminate as many enemies as possible!

The sun is almost rising; keep going strong!


AFTER THE WAVE

Congratulations, you made it through the wave!

Now, let’s prepare for tonight’s enemy wave!

I have heard that the grand monster would come from that side of the city. Try to build more there! [WHILE INDICATING TO THE REFERRED COAST]


FINAL BOSS

Look, it is the grand monster! We must eliminate it to stop the enemies from returning to our city!


AFTER THE FINAL BOSS

We made it! We eliminated the grand monster! Our city is safe now. Thank you for saving us, [USERNAME]!

HINTS

Hint: Build the city all over the coasts because the enemies are going to come from every side of the city.

Hint: Try to even up the development on each coast so that the crystal would be protected from every side.

Hint: Build more on the point where the grand monster will rise because it will be harder to eliminate!
