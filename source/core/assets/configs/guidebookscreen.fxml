        <body>
            Protect the crystal from the sea enemies by using your character to source materials and currency to create weaponry and buildings that attack and defend. Use the day to build up your defences and prepare for the havoc of the night.
            The game is won when all 4-night cycles, which includes the big boss level, are beaten.
            The game is lost when the crystal has lost all health.

        <header>Crystal</header>
        <body>
            The crystal must be protected at all costs. The health of the crystal rises with the help of upgrades found in the shop and durations of time without being attacked and falls with the exposure to enemies. You can track the crystal health with the crystal health status bar.
            Tip: build your defences in the best positions to beat the enemies.

            Building Type 3 - Obstacle: Obstacles hinder the enemies from moving efficiently with the ultimate purpose of slowing them down in their attack. There are four different obstacles: Wooden Fence, Brick Wall, House, and Temple. Walls and fences can be placed as protection measures to restrict access to parts of land whilst the House and Temple are used to distract and protect enemies from other priority elements in the game.
